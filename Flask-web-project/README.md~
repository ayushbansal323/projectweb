# Book Review Site

This is a web-based project which helps users to give ratings and revive of the books and also so see ratings and review given by others. 

It also provides the standard Goodread rating for the books. For this, we have used Goodreads API.

The project uses Flash micro Framework in python for the backend, It also uses Jinga2 as a templating language to generate dynamics pages.
